% Managing group tasks effectively while keeping team members motivated is a significant challenge. Traditional task management tools lack engagement, and manual performance evaluation methods fail to scale efficiently. This project introduces WorkQuest, an AI-powered gamified task management system, where teams complete tasks to battle a boss monster. Task completion directly impacts the boss fight, with late or incomplete tasks causing penalties such as boss counterattacks.
% To ensure fair and meaningful contribution tracking, WorkQuest integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for personalized performance evaluation and feedback. The system analyzes user performance through task completion rates, time spent on work, task quality, and sentiment analysis from team interactions. ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) classify user performance, while time-series models (LSTM, ARIMA) predict trends in work habits. NLP models (BERT, VADER Sentiment Analysis) assess communication quality, providing automated feedback in positive or negative contexts.
% By combining gamification mechanics with AI-driven adaptive learning, WorkQuest enhances teamwork, increases motivation, and improves task efficiency. The system provides real-time feedback, reduces manual workload for managers, and dynamically adjusts task difficulty to match team productivity. Even if AI predictions are not perfect, the system significantly improves engagement, fairness, and accountability in group projects.


% One of the biggest challenges is effectively managing tasks in a team and keeping them motivated. Traditional task management tools are uninteresting, and performance evaluation processes through traditional means do not scale. This project introduces WorkQuest, a gamified task management system with AI in which teams undertake tasks to defeat a boss monster. The task progress directly affects the battle, with delays or incomplete tasks incurring penalties in terms of boss counterattacks.
% To enable fair and effective contribution tracking, WorkQuest integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide customized performance evaluation and feedback. The system tracks user performance in terms of task completion rate, work time, task quality, and sentiment analysis from interactions with teams. ML algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost categorize user performance, and time-series algorithms such as LSTM and ARIMA predict work habit patterns. NLP algorithms such as BERT and VADER Sentiment Analysis also evaluate communication quality and give automated feedback in positive and negative scenarios.
% Through a combination of gamification and AI-driven adaptive learning, WorkQuest can enhance collaboration, motivation, and effectiveness in tasks. The system gives immediate feedback, reduces managers' workload, and automatically varies task difficulty according to team performance. AI predictions can't always be perfect, but WorkQuest significantly improves collaboration, equality, and accountability in collaborative ventures.
