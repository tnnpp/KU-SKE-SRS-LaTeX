% <TIP: Write user stories for each of your stakeholders here./>

% User stories are a technique used in agile software
% development to capture and describe functional requirements from an end
% user's perspective. They are a way of expressing software features or
% functionality in a simple, non-technical language that can be easily understood
% by both developers and stakeholders.

\section{Use Case Diagram}
\label{section:use-case-diagram}
<TIP: Write a use case diagram for your project here. Refer to an
article “What is a use case diagram?” by Lucidchart for help./>

\section{Use Case Model}
\label{section:use-case-model}
A use case is a detailed description of how a system
interacts with an external entity (such as a user or another system) to
accomplish a specific goal. Use cases provide a high-level view of the
functionality of a system and help in capturing and documenting its
requirements from the perspective of end users.

<TIP: Write use cases for your project here. Make sure to use the
appropriate type of use case for each scenario (brief, casual, and fully-dressed
use case)./>

\section{User Interface Design}
\label{section:user-interface-design}
<TIP: Put the initial design of your application here. You can
showcase a detailed design of a specific page or a sitemap of your application.
See an example below./>
